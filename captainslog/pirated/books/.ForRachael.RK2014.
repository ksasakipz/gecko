Consider this a rough draft of my wedding vows.
I vow to love you until the day I die.
I vow to remain loyal to you until the day I die.
I vow to learn how to love you better and better each day.
I vow to give to you my mind, my body, and my soul.
I vow to stand up for you in the face of adversity.
I vow to protect you from the evils of the world.
I vow to to try my best to grow, foster, and spread the happiness you hold within your heart so that others may experience the joy I feel when in your presence.
I know that I have made mistakes in the past.
I am sorry.
I cannot change what is in the past.
I can only promise to be a better partner for the future.
I will protect my promise with one thing...
I will protect my promise with two words..
I will protect my promise with one holiday.
I will protect my promise by giving you one present.
Merry Christmas
