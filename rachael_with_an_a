echo Consider this a rough draft of my wedding vows.
echo I vow to love you until the day I die.
echo I vow to remain loyal to you until the day I die.
echo I vow to learn how to love you better and better each day.
echo I vow to give to you my mind, my body, and my soul.
echo I vow to stand up for you in the face of adversity.
echo I vow to protect you from the evils of the world.
echo I vow to to try my best to grow, foster, and spread the happiness you hold within your heart so that others may experience the joy I feel when in your presence.
echo I know that I have made mistakes in the past.
echo I am sorry.
echo I cannot change what is in the past.
echo I can only promise to be a better partner for the future.
echo I will protect my promise with one thing...
echo I will protect my promise with two words..
echo I will protect my promise with one holiday.
echo I will protect my promise by giving you one present.
echo Merry Christmas
