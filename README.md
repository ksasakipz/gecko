Notes on chmod
chmod assumes three classes of people
1. user (u) the person who created the file
2. group (g) people in the selected group
3. other (o) everyone else on the system
The three classes of people have three classes of permissions each
1. read (r) ability to see the contents of the file
2. write (w) ability to change the contents of the file
3. execute (x) ability to execute the contents of the file
The command 'ls -l' will display the listing of files and their permissions
