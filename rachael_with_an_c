echo My proposal
echo As you know, I'm an awkward turtle, and you are an awkward octopus.
echo What you might not know is that I have come to the conclusion that you are my soul mate.
echo I have arrived at this conclusion based on the feelings I have for you and the fact that despite our time apart, they are never fading.
echo If you still have that Rubik's cube that I gave you, I believe on of the sides said something along the lines of:
echo 
echo CS
echo and
echo PT
echo we
echo are
echo a 
echo power
echo couple

echo My proposal is to support you in your career endeavors, regardless of whether or not you are a physical therapist or something else in life. One of the disagreements we had during our freshman year of college, when I said "I can do anything"
echo I wasn't aware of it at the time, but the "anything" in question is "fixing" society.
echo Now, I understand that "fixing" society is subjective and an abstract concept.
echo What is objective and a tangible, phsyical thing is what people call "The Internet".
echo However, after learning about computer science at Harvey Mudd College, the best college you've never heard of,
echo It is clear to me that "The Internet" is has a bug.
echo You see, "The Internet" is nothing more than a facade, a ruse, a trick, played on us by The Government.
echo What am I talking about when I say The Government you ask?
echo Why, The Republic of America course!
